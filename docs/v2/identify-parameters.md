# Explanation of the `IdentifyParameters` Type

`IdentifyParameters` is an advanced TypeScript utility type designed to pinpoint the required parameters for an API endpoint by combining the key properties from the entry type and any additional options. This type ensures that all required parameters are explicitly marked as required, facilitating strong type-checking for API operations.

## Type Definition

```typescript
type IdentifyParameters<
  M extends TESIEntryMethod,
  EPx extends ESIEndpointOf<M> | string,
  Opt extends Record<string, unknown>,
  AdditionalParams,
  Entry = _ESIResponseType<M, EPx> & AdditionalParams,
  RequireKeys = Exclude<keyof (Entry & AdditionalParams), "result" | "tag" | "cachedSeconds">
  // @ts-expect-error 
> = RestrictKeys<Opt, RequireKeys> & Pick<Entry, RequireKeys> & AdditionalParams;
```

## Template Parameters

- **`M extends TESIEntryMethod`**  
  Specifies the HTTP method (e.g., `"get"`, `"post"`, `"delete"`, etc.) used for the API request. This allows the type system to select the appropriate endpoint and response types.

- **`EPx extends ESIEndpointOf<M> | string`**  
  Denotes the endpoint path. It can be a specific parameterized endpoint corresponding to the method or a generic endpoint represented as a string.

- **`Opt extends Record<string, unknown>`**  
  Represents the additional options provided by the user. These options are expected to be an object whose keys are strings.

- **`AdditionalParams`**  
  These are extra parameters that, when merged with the entry type, give a more comprehensive view of the API parameters.

- **`Entry = _ESIResponseType<M, EPx> & AdditionalParams`**  
  This type combines the inferred response type for the given HTTP method and endpoint with the additional parameters. It serves as the base type from which the required keys are extracted.

- **`RequireKeys = Exclude<keyof (Entry & AdditionalParams), "result" | "tag" | "cachedSeconds">`**  
  This calculates the keys that are considered required by excluding common metadata keys (`"result"`, `"tag"`, and `"cachedSeconds"`) from the combined type.

## How It Works

1. **Merging Types**  
   The type first merges the API response type (`_ESIResponseType<M, EPx>`) with any additional parameters passed as `AdditionalParams` to form the composite type `Entry`.

2. **Identifying Required Keys**  
   It then computes `RequireKeys` by taking the keys of the merged type and excluding the metadata keys (`"result"`, `"tag"`, `"cachedSeconds"`). These remaining keys are treated as required parameters.

3. **Restricting Additional Options**  
   The helper type `RestrictKeys<Opt, RequireKeys>` ensures that the additional options in `Opt` are limited only to the keys identified as required. This adds an extra layer of type-safety.

4. **Final Combination**  
   Finally, the type returns the intersection:
   - `RestrictKeys<Opt, RequireKeys>` restricts `Opt` to only the required keys.
   - `Pick<Entry, RequireKeys>` extracts the corresponding values from the merged entry type.
   - `AdditionalParams` is intersected in the end, ensuring that any extra provided parameters are also included.
   
   This results in a final type that accurately represents only the required parameters for an API endpoint.

## Practical Example

```typescript
type ExampleEntry = { result: string, tag: string, cachedSeconds: number, auth: string };
type ExampleOpt = { auth: string };
type IdentifiedParams = IdentifyParameters<"get", "/example/endpoint", ExampleOpt, ExampleEntry>;
// Result: { auth: string } & { auth: string }
```

In this example:
- `ExampleEntry` includes metadata keys along with the essential key `auth`.
- `ExampleOpt` specifies that `auth` is required.
- `IdentifyParameters` processes these inputs and produces a type that enforces the `auth` parameter as required, ensuring accurate and reliable type-checking.

---

`IdentifyParameters` thus plays a crucial role in extracting and enforcing the required parameters from API definitions, merging inherent parameters with additional options into a concise, strongly-typed structure.
